# Image Resize App - Vision Document

## Discussion & Refinement
> This section serves as our collaborative space to discuss and refine the vision. Please add your thoughts, questions, and suggestions below each topic.

### Current Discussion Points

1. **Target Audience**
   - Current Focus: General users who need simple image resizing
   - Questions to consider:
     - Should we target specific professional segments?
     - What unique needs do different user groups have?
   - Your thoughts: [No comment. I find this currently irrelevant.]

2. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Current roadmap shows batch processing in Phase 2
   - Discussion:
     - Is this the right ordering?
     - What features would provide the most immediate value?
   - Your thoughts: [I think the "Image format conversion" and #Basic image editing (crop, rotate)" features should be in phase 3. We do not need those yet.]

3. **Technical Decisions**
   - Current: Client-side processing with Canvas API
   - Discussion:
     - Should we consider server-side processing for larger images?
     - What are the trade-offs between performance and functionality?
   - Your thoughts: [Add your perspective here]

4. **Monetization Strategy**
   - Not currently addressed in vision
   - Questions to consider:
     - Should we have a freemium model?
     - What features would be premium vs free?
